# Substrings anagrams

Java exercise to improve my skills:<Br><br>
This is not a normal anagram counter. Here we are looking for SUBSTRINGS (inside a bigger string) that have the same characters, they are anagrams of each other.<Br><br>
Examples:<br>
- Input: "ovo" Output: 2  || ['o', 'o,] and ['ov', 'vo'] 
- Input: "ifailuhkqq" Output: 3  ||  ['i', 'i'], ['q', 'q'] and ['ifa', 'fai']
